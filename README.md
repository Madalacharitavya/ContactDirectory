As we all busy with our daily works, isn’t easy to remember our family, friends and other details or contact numbers. so, our task is to implement a smartphone directory that collects contact data from the user until the user prompts the program to contact data refers to the contact’s name, phone number, date-of-birth, a category that contact belongs to (Friends, Family, Work, Other), e-mail address. The user may enter as much data as he can in the mentioned data labels. If some labels remain void of data, store it as None. A name & the number is mandatory to create contact. Implement the following operations on the directory: Insert, Delete, Search, Display.
We have developed this project by using 8 functions, namely:
Initial _phonebook() : The first function to run, it initializes the phonebook.
Menu (): It displays the choices available to the user and returns the choice entered.
Add _contact (): It adds a new contact to the Contacts directory.
Remove _existing (): It removes an existing contact from the Contacts directory.
Delete _all (): It deletes all the contacts from the Contacts directory.
display_ all (): It displays all the contacts from the Contacts directory.
Search _existing (): It will search and display an existing contact in the Contacts directory.  Thanks ():
